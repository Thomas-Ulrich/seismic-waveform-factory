# seismic-waveform-factory

This repository contains a set of Python scripts for earthquake source modeling
 and synthetic seismogram generation.
It can be used, for example, to generate equivalent multi-CMT solutions and
 produce regional or teleseismic synthetics to compare with observations.

For more details, see the [documentation](https://seismic-waveform-factory.readthedocs.io).
